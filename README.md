## Setup

### 1. Enable internet access

Skills use `web_fetch` and `web_search` to fetch and analyze web pages.

- **Claude Code:** Internet access is available by default
- **Claude Web:** Go to **Settings → Capabilities** and enable **"Allow network egress"**. Add the domain you're trying to audit to the Domain allowlist.

---

### 2. Connect Ahrefs MCP (optional)

- A paid Ahrefs account gives you access to real keyword data.
- A paid or free account gives you access to AI engine visibility.
- Without either, those skills use web-scraped estimates instead of actual search volumes, difficulty scores, and competitor traffic.

### Claude Web Limitations

Claude Web can run these skills, but with reduced capability when running `aeo-seo-site-audit`, as compared to Claude Code:

| Feature | Claude Code | Claude Web |
|---|---|---|
| Fetch page content | ✅ Full | ✅ Full (requires network egress enabled) |
| Extract JSON-LD schema | ✅ Full (via `curl`) | ❌ Not available — `WebFetch` strips script tags |

**Schema markup** is the most significant gap. `WebFetch` converts HTML to markdown, which strips `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks entirely. When running the site audit on Claude Web:
- The skill will note which pages could not have schema inspected
- You'll be prompted to check schema manually using [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- For full schema coverage, run the audit in Claude Code

## Quick Start

### Want Everything in One Report?
Use **`aeo-seo-strategy-orchestrator`** for a unified audit that runs all three core skills, synthesizes recommendations into one list, and includes site/product improvements alongside content strategy.

Or, run each core skill separately. 
```
* aeo-topic-research           →  Discover what topics to target for AEO
* seo-keyword-research      →  Find competitive keywords and content gaps
* aeo-seo-site-audit           →  Audit & optimize your pages for SEO and AEO
```
