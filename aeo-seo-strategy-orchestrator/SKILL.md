# Full SEO/AEO Strategy Skill

This skill is the all-in-one SEO/AEO and product strategy audit. It orchestrates the three core skills (`aeo-topic-research`, `seo-keyword-research`, and `aeo-seo-site-audit`), each of which includes domain-specific recommendations, then synthesizes all findings into a unified list.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks for a "complete SEO/AEO strategy"
- Wants a "full audit with recommendations"
- Needs a "comprehensive SEO strategy" that covers everything
- Requests "SEO strategy including site improvements"
- Asks for "SEO + product/UX recommendations in one strategy"
- Says "audit my site and competitors, then tell me what to do"

**This is the right skill to use when the user wants everything in one go** — research, competitive analysis, site audit, *plus* site functionality/UX improvements.

## Core Workflow

1. Run `aeo-topic-research` → identify AI-driven content opportunities (includes Content Presentation Recommendations)
2. Run `seo-keyword-research` → surface keyword gaps and quick wins (includes Information Architecture Recommendations)
3. Run `aeo-seo-site-audit` → assess technical SEO, content, and AEO optimization (includes Technical UX Recommendations)
4. Synthesize all findings into one unified, ranked strategy report

## Inputs

### Required
- **Your domain/brand** — the site you're optimizing

### Recommended
- **Ahrefs account** — for real keyword volume, difficulty, and traffic data

### Optional
- **Target URLs** — pages to audit (typically 5–10 core pages)
- **Competitor domains** — 2–5 competitors to analyze
- **Market/niche** — to scope the research accurately
- **Current pain points** — conversion issues, UX friction, known problems
- **Business goals** — revenue, traffic, brand authority targets
- **Target AI engines** — which to prioritize (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini)

## Output

### 1. Strategic Overview (Executive Summary)
- Current state assessment
- Key opportunities and gaps
- Strategic priorities and expected impact

### 2. Prioritized Recommendations

A single unified list of recommendations ranked by impact and effort, drawing from all three core skills plus functionality analysis. Each recommendation includes:
- What to do (specific, actionable)
- Why it matters (expected impact)
- Category (Technical SEO / Content / AEO / Product/UX)
- Effort estimate (Quick / Moderate / Major)

### 3. Detailed Findings by Category

#### AEO Topic Research Findings
- High-opportunity topics for AI citations
- Recommended content formats and structures
- Cited competitors and domains to monitor
- Topic prioritization matrix

#### SEO/Keyword Strategy Findings
- Keyword tiers (Quick Wins / Strategic / Long-term)
- Competitive positioning analysis
- Traffic opportunity summary with ROI

#### Site Audit Findings
- Technical SEO issues (severity-ranked)
- Content quality gaps
- Current AEO optimization level
- On-page quick fixes vs. strategic improvements

#### Functionality & UX Recommendations (Synthesized)
Unified recommendations synthesized from all three core skills:

**From Topic Research:**
- Content presentation improvements (format, navigation, multimedia, scannability)

**From Keyword Research:**
- Information architecture changes (navigation structure, hub pages, internal linking, silos)

**From Site Audit:**
- Technical UX improvements (page load, mobile optimization, navigation UX, CTAs, accessibility)

Each recommendation includes:
- Specific change with affected pages/sections
- Why it matters (impact on users or rankings)
- Estimated effort and impact

### 4. Implementation Details
- Content brief templates
- Technical checklist
- Feature specifications (high-level)
- Success metrics and KPIs to track
