# Full SEO/AEO Strategy Skill

This skill is the comprehensive, all-in-one SEO/AEO and product strategy audit. It orchestrates the three core skills (`core-aeo-topic-research`, `core-seo-competitor-keywords`, and `core-aeo-seo-site-audit`), synthesizes their findings into a unified strategic roadmap, and goes beyond content by analyzing site functionality and recommending structural/UX improvements.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Asks for a "complete SEO/AEO strategy"
- Wants a "full audit with roadmap and recommendations"
- Needs a "comprehensive SEO strategy" that covers everything
- Requests "SEO strategy including site improvements"
- Wants to "overhaul our SEO and improve our website"
- Needs an "executive-ready strategic report" for stakeholders
- Asks for "SEO + product/UX recommendations in one strategy"
- Says "audit my site and competitors, then tell me what to do"

**This is the right skill to use when the user wants everything in one go** — research, competitive analysis, site audit, *plus* site functionality/UX improvements.

## Core Workflow

1. **Gather Comprehensive Input**
   - Target brand/domain
   - 2–5 competitor domains
   - Current website URLs to audit
   - Market/niche information
   - Target AI engines (optional)
   - Current site/app pain points or goals (optional)
   - Ahrefs account credentials (optional, but recommended)

2. **Run core-aeo-topic-research**
   - Discover what topics AI engines are answering in the niche
   - Mine cited domains and pages
   - Identify content gaps and opportunities
   - Generate topic priorities

3. **Run core-seo-competitor-keywords**
   - Analyze competitor SEO strategies
   - Identify keyword gaps and opportunities
   - Rank keywords by difficulty, volume, and potential
   - Surface quick-win and strategic opportunities

4. **Run core-aeo-seo-site-audit**
   - Crawl target website pages
   - Analyze technical SEO, content quality, and AEO optimization
   - Identify on-page issues and improvement opportunities
   - Score current optimization level

5. **Analyze Site Functionality & UX**
   - Review site architecture and navigation
   - Identify conversion funnel bottlenecks
   - Assess mobile responsiveness and usability
   - Evaluate technical performance (speed, accessibility, core web vitals)
   - Identify feature gaps or friction points related to user journey
   - Recommend product/feature changes that support SEO and conversion

6. **Synthesize into Unified Strategy**
   - Create integrated, cross-functional prioritized recommendations list
   - Rank recommendations by impact and effort
   - Show relationships between content, SEO, AEO, and product improvements

7. **Generate Executive Report**
   - Strategic overview and key metrics
   - Prioritized recommendations list (unified, ranked across all categories)
   - Detailed findings grouped by category

## Key Differentiator

**Functionality Analysis:** Goes beyond on-page SEO to recommend:
- Site architecture changes (e.g., better internal linking structure, new pillar pages)
- Feature additions (e.g., tools, calculators, filters that improve user experience and AEO citations)
- Technical infrastructure (e.g., pagination, canonicalization, structured data automation)
- Conversion funnel improvements (how SEO/AEO strategy ties to business outcomes)
- Mobile and accessibility enhancements
- Content delivery mechanisms (e.g., interactive tools, API-driven content)

## Inputs

### Required
- **Your domain/brand** — the site you're optimizing

### Recommended
- **Ahrefs account** — for real keyword volume, difficulty, and traffic data

### Optional
- **Target URLs** — pages to audit (typically 5–10 core pages)
- **Competitor domains** — 2–5 competitors to analyze
- **Market/niche** — to scope the research accurately
- **Current pain points** — conversion issues, UX friction, known problems
- **Business goals** — revenue, traffic, brand authority targets
- **Target AI engines** — which to prioritize (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini)

## Output

### 1. Strategic Overview (Executive Summary)
- Current state assessment
- Key opportunities and gaps
- Strategic priorities and expected impact
- Resource and timeline estimates

### 2. Prioritized Recommendations

A single unified list of recommendations ranked by impact and effort, drawing from all three core skills plus functionality analysis. Each recommendation includes:
- What to do (specific, actionable)
- Why it matters (expected impact)
- Category (Technical SEO / Content / AEO / Product/UX)
- Effort estimate (Quick / Moderate / Major)

### 3. Detailed Findings by Category

#### AEO Topic Research Findings
- High-opportunity topics for AI citations
- Recommended content formats and structures
- Cited competitors and domains to monitor
- Topic prioritization matrix

#### SEO/Keyword Strategy Findings
- Keyword tiers (Quick Wins / Strategic / Long-term)
- Competitive positioning analysis
- Traffic opportunity summary with ROI

#### Site Audit Findings
- Technical SEO issues (severity-ranked)
- Content quality gaps
- Current AEO optimization level
- On-page quick fixes vs. strategic improvements

#### Functionality & UX Recommendations
- Site architecture improvements
- Feature recommendations (with business case)
- Technical infrastructure changes
- Performance and mobile optimizations
- Conversion funnel recommendations
- Estimated effort and impact for each recommendation

### 4. Implementation Details
- Content brief templates
- Technical checklist
- Feature specifications (high-level)
- Success metrics and KPIs to track

## User Communication

**Refer to [TONE-GUIDE.md](../TONE-GUIDE.md) for comprehensive tone and communication guidelines.**

Key principles for strategy output:
- Present strategic analysis as objective assessment backed by data
- Use quantified metrics for all impact claims ("Expected +15-20% CTR improvement" not "huge improvement")
- Explain mechanisms of competitive advantage with data (citation counts, ranking positions, search volume)
- Neutral language: "Competitors rank for 250 keywords we don't" not "huge opportunity gap"
- All recommendations must include effort estimates and measurable outcomes

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need Ahrefs for this skill?**
A: No, but it's strongly recommended. Without Ahrefs, keyword volume and difficulty are estimates. With Ahrefs, you get exact data and more accurate prioritization. Optional, but highly valuable.

**Q: How long does this take to run?**
A: Typically 45–90 minutes depending on site size, number of competitors, and Ahrefs availability. Plan for a full async session with this skill.

**Q: Will this give me a content plan?**
A: Yes. The prioritized recommendations list includes content creation priorities synthesized from all three skills' findings.

**Q: Can this recommend specific product features?**
A: Yes, and it will. The skill evaluates how competitors use features (tools, calculators, comparisons, filters, etc.) to win rankings and citations, then recommends which features would most improve your competitive position.

**Q: What if recommendations conflict?**
A: The skill resolves conflicts by prioritizing business impact and ease of implementation. For example, if content strategy says "write a comparison guide" but your site lacks filtering UI, the roadmap will sequence: build filter feature → write comparison guide.
